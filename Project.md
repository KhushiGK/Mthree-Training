## üîç Problem Statement

A modern banking institution needs a robust, secure, and scalable system to manage various banking operations such as customer onboarding, account management, transactions (deposit, withdrawal, transfer), user authentication, and support ticketing. The system must also maintain historical records for auditing and regulatory compliance.

The goal is to design and implement a comprehensive **Banking System** that enables seamless interaction between customers, staff, and banking services, while ensuring data integrity, traceability, and ease of management.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The architecture of the Banking System is designed to be modular and scalable, composed of multiple interacting layers and services:

### **1. Frontend Layer**
- Built using **ReactJS**
- Communicates with the backend through REST APIs
- Responsible for user interaction and UI rendering

### **2. Backend Layer**
- Developed with **Django (Python)**
- Handles business logic and database operations
- Includes API endpoints, authentication, and transaction processing

### **3. Celery Workers**
- Used for background processing (e.g., sending emails, logs)
- Task queue powered by **Redis**

### **4. Database Layer**
- **SQLite** stores structured banking data
- Tables include customer, account, transaction, logs, etc.

### **5. Monitoring & Observability**
- **Prometheus** scrapes metrics from Django and Redis
- **Grafana** visualizes real-time data and system health

### **6. CI/CD Pipeline**
- **Jenkins** automates build, test, and deployment
- Integrated with GitHub and DockerHub

### **7. Containerization & Orchestration**
- **Docker** used to containerize each service (frontend, backend, workers)
- **Kubernetes** orchestrates services and manages deployments, networking, scaling

##üí° Why This Project?

In today's digital-first world, banking systems require high performance, security, and scalability. Traditional banking software often lacks real-time responsiveness, modularity, and integration with modern DevOps practices. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a robust solution using modern technologies like Django, React, Docker, and Kubernetes.

By implementing this system, we address real-world challenges such as:
- Efficient customer onboarding and user management.
- Secure transaction processing and logging.
- Scalable infrastructure deployment.
- Real-time monitoring and alerting.

It reflects how modern banking infrastructures can evolve to stay competitive while remaining user-centric and reliable.
